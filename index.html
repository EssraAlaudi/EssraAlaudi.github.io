  <h1>Welcome to Essra Alaudi's ePortfolio!</h1>
  <p>Here, you'll find projects developed during my Computer Science studies at SNHU.</p>

  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

<p>Throughout my Computer Science program, I believe I’ve grown significantly in both my technical abilities and personal development. Beyond just learning how to code, I’ve developed persistence in the face of challenges and a stronger ability to recognize areas where I can improve. Learning, to me, is a lifelong process, one that holds many exciting opportunities for growth, discovery, and reflection. I intend to carry this mindset into future endeavors and allow it to continue shaping how I approach problems. </p>

<p>That said, my journey has helped me build a foundation in key areas of computer science, including software development, algorithms, databases, and security. One example is in CS-250:Software Development Lifecycle, where I gained a better idea of how it would be like to engage in collaborative projects in the field of computer science, working with both users and stakeholders.This helped me appreciate the essence of teamwork and how important it is to communicate clearly, manage time effectively, practice diligence, understand team roles, and value each member’s contributions. </p>

<p>In another course, CS-319 UI/UX:Design and Development, I learned to conduct and evaluate user testing to guide user experience design. This experience challenged me to think from the user's perspective and make design choices that prioritize usability, intuitiveness, and organization. </p>

<p>Another example is in CS-370: Current and Emerging Computer Science Trends, where algorithmic decision-making was studied through reinforcement learning, and basic data structures were applied to represent the environment and store agent behavior. Key principles of Software Engineering and Design were further developed in CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming, which involved implementing practical programming structures and logic, integrating a database, and incorporating basic security features. </p>

<p>The projects selected for this portfolio were chosen because they represent a wide range of skills  demonstrated throughout the program. These artifacts align with the three main categories: software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Together, they form a cohesive portfolio that reflects both depth in each area and breadth across the field of computer science. Each contributes to the overarching program goals by demonstrating the ability to design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and established computer science practices and standards. They also reflect the application of well-founded techniques, tools, and skills in computing practice, along with the development of a security mindset - one that helps reduce design laws and enhance privacy and security.</p>

  <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>

  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
<p>The reason I chose to include this inventory app in my ePortfolio is because it fits into the category of software engineering and design and showcases several important skills in software development. These skills include working with a database, handling permissions and error conditions, designing a user-friendly interface, and applying role-based access control. The artifact was improved through enhancements such as adding a search feature, implementing role-based restrictions, and refining both the layout and documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Course outcomes met:</strong> 3, 4, and 5.</p>
<p>These outcomes were demonstrated through this project because it was designed using practical programming structures and logic. Features like search functionality, role-based access, and database interactions reflect the application of algorithmic principles while utilizing well-founded techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices. Additionally, protective design principles were incorporated to anticipate potential vulnerabilities and promote privacy and security, such as limiting access through roles and using invite codes for controlled user registration.</p>

<p>The process of enhancing and modifying the artifact involved refinement, testing, and continuous adjustments. I also visited a variety of resources during the development of the enhancements. Through this experience, I became more aware of how much I still have to learn and feel increasingly motivated to grow.</p>

<p>Some specific challenges I faced during this enhancement included trying to figure out how to implement the search functionality, something I wasn't able to complete the last time I worked on this project, and better understanding how the role-based access control would work. Additionally, I also found it difficult to design and organize the new layout for the Admin inventory screen in a way that made sense. Although I needed help along the way, this project helped me recognize the value of seeking guidance, learning by doing, and staying persistent even when things feel difficult.</p>
