  <h1>Welcome to Essra Alaudi's ePortfolio!</h1>
  <p> Here, you'll find projects I developed during my Computer Science studies at SNHU.</p>

  <h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
   <p>Throughout my Computer Science program, I believe I’ve grown significantly in both my technical abilities and personal development. Beyond just learning how to code, I’ve developed persistence in the face of challenges and a stronger ability to recognize areas where I can improve. Learning, to me, is a lifelong process, one that holds many exciting opportunities for growth, discovery, and reflection. I intend to carry this mindset into future endeavors and allow it to continue shaping how I approach problems. That said, my journey has helped me build a foundation in key areas of computer science, including software development, algorithms, databases, and security. One example is in CS-250:Software Development Lifecycle, where I gained a better idea of how it would be like to engage in collaborative projects in the field of computer science, working with both users and stakeholders.This helped me appreciate the essence of teamwork and how important it is to communicate clearly, manage time effectively, practice diligence, understand team roles, and value each member’s contributions. In another course, CS-319 UI/UX:Design and Development, I learned to conduct and evaluate user testing to guide user experience design. This experience challenged me to think from the user's perspective and make design choices that prioritize usability, intuitiveness, and organization. Another example is in CS-370: Current and Emerging Computer Science Trends, where algorithmic decision-making was studied through reinforcement learning, and basic data structures were applied to represent the environment and store agent behavior. Key principles of Software Engineering and Design were further developed in CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming, which involved implementing practical programming structures and logic, integrating a database, and incorporating basic security features.
The projects selected for this portfolio were chosen because they represent a wide range of skills  demonstrated throughout the program. These artifacts align with the three main categories: software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Together, they form a cohesive portfolio that reflects both depth in each area and breadth across the field of computer science. Each contributes to the overarching program goals by demonstrating the ability to design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and established computer science practices and standards. They also reflect the application of well-founded techniques, tools, and skills in computing practice, along with the development of a security mindset - one that helps reduce design laws and enhance privacy and security.
